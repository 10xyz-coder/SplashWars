# SplashWars 💦🔴🔵🟢
This is the online server for Splash Wars, a multiplayer dev project about splashing others.

## How it Works ❓🔧
When players connect, Godot sends a message to the main brain. The brain then READS/WRITES data and sends it back to Godot. 
Then Godot parses the json and loads all the players, bullets, and objects
